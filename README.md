A Screen for your MSA millennium, 


# Code
Code is running circuitpython, I would suggest using Thonny to install. 
Put the code and the two folders (imgs & lib) in the root of the device - always eject your CIRCUTPYTHON Drive before removing or you will have to bootload and reflash the firmware. 



You will need 
- 1x https://www.waveshare.com/product/rp2040-touch-lcd-1.28.htm - make sure to get the touch screen one, you can find these on alliexpress
- 1x battery, the device uses 1.25mm JST connectors so you need to find something that matches that or take extreme care in sodering the correct plug on. 
- some m2 threaded inserts and some 16-20mm screws, the printerbles link has more on this. 

# 3D Printing, I found the front piece needed a slightly larger margin to hole the screen more snuggly so I've uploaded that mod here.
